## 👋 Hello, World! I'm Myriam Kerkeni!

Once upon a time in the land of dietetics, I discovered my passion for **software engineering** at 42 Nice, and now I’m exploring the exciting world of coding! 💻✨

Currently, I’m immersing myself in **Python**, **Django**, and **SQL** as I work on my last common core project, ft_transcendence—a dynamic website that lets users play Pong and chat in real time! 🕹️💬

## 🚀 What I’m Up To
- **Building Awesome Projects**: With ft_transcendence, I’m teaming up with my awesome group to blend gaming and communication, creating a space where users can challenge each other in Pong while sharing laughs and strategies in a live chat! 

- **Teamwork Makes the Dream Work**: Collaborating with my talented teammates has been a highlight. Together, we tackle challenges, share laughs, and occasionally wonder why we chose to code instead of napping. 😴💤  

- **Learning Every Day**: Each project is a new opportunity to learn something exciting (or at least to debug furiously)!

## 🎉 Fun Facts About Me
- I can cook delicious cannellonis, but I'm still figuring out how to cook up clean code! 🍝🧑‍🍳 

- I love tuning into personal development podcasts to fuel my growth mindset—because who doesn’t want to be the best version of themselves? 🎧✨

- If I'm not coding, you can find me lost in a good drama series or singing along to my favorite tunes (even if my voice isn't the best)! 😄. 🎶  

So, welcome to my GitHub! Feel free to check out my projects, throw me a star or two, and let’s connect!  

Let’s code, create, and conquer the digital world together! 🌍💻
